This repository is a list of resources that were useful for me, and may be useful for you. If you find your name on this list, know that you rock. If you don't, maybe one day you will.
Before anything, I would like to say that you are very unlikely to really understand (and remember) everything from any of these sources first try. You will need to rewatch/read a lot of stuff. This is fine. Also, nothing will make up for actual practice, so just program whenever you can. And that rhymes.

## Begginer stuff
Even if you've been around for a long time, sometimes you just never got to learn something really basic.
[boot.dev](boot.dev) - This course is sold as meant for backend web developers, but there is a lot for everyone here. It *is* paid, but you can get all the content for free.
[Fabio Akita](https://www.youtube.com/@Akitando) - Watch a video, get lost in the middle, note down a bunch of learning materials youtube guy said were good, study them, rewatch video, get lost halfway through, repeat until oblivion. I still think this is a good place to start because it teaches you how complex things actually are (and also the things themselves). If you can speak Portuguese, watch every single video of this channel. If you can't, learn Portuguese first. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
[Simple code, high performance by Casey Muratori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge3aKEmZcqY) - When I started programming, people were talking about OOP this, DRY that, clean code here, SOLID there. And I thought I was dumb and my code completly sucked. Turns out, just solving the problem is the best way to solve actual problems (I know, mindtwisting). If you find yourself in this situation, watch this video and its 2 follow-up parts.

## Software quality
Software is getting worse. Just [take a look around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4b3XGMdpD0). Don't be part of it. Make it better.
[Preventing the collapse of civilization by Jonathan Blow](https://youtu.be/ZSRHeXYDLko?si=CCT4GnA3nisB-imX) - This should be class 1 on every course.
[Better Software Conference (BSC)](https://www.youtube.com/@BetterSoftwareConference) - A conference by people who care about software quality. Most talks are great.
[Refterm by Casey Muratori](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEMXAbCVnmY6zCgpCFlgggRkrp0tpWfrn) - Break down of the development of a non-optimized terminal which is still 100x more performant than Windows' terminal.
[Computer, enhance by Casey Muratori](https://www.computerenhance.com/) - Enhance the computer. Also Handmade Hero guy. Be aware it is a paid course, you can get some content for free though.

## Data structures and algorithms
Of utmost importance; job interview get employed; Fibonacci sequence; Made-up calculus formulas noone truly understands.
[The last algorithms course you'll need by Theprimeagen](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) - I don't know if it is the last course you'll need, but it's a good start. And for free. 
[Algorithms by Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O) - The man. The goat. Just watch and learn. I recommend watching the previous course and complementing it with this playlist. Come back as you need. This is your new home. Welcome.

## Computer. Bip bop.
Programmer job make computer do thing. So you better understand how it happens. It shouldn't be a hot take that you have to understand how computers work as a programmer.
*Usually, sources meant for programmers will keep it high level. If you constantly find yourself in pain when details get abstracted from you, maybe you are more of a hardware person. Just saying.
[From NAND to Tetris by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) - A free course that guides you from logical gates to an actual computer.
[Exploring how computers work by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq) - A guy making logical gates simulations. Really cool. He gets all the way through RAM simulation. Maybe there will be more in the future.
[Building an 8-bit breadboard computer! by Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) - A guy building a computer from scratch.
[What every programmer should know about memory by Ulrich Drepper](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf) - Pretty much what the name implies.
[Discussion with Casey Muratori about how easy precedence is... by Jonathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIPO4G42wYE) - I think this video is a good way to start understanding how the compiler does compiler stuff.

## Maths
If you are not convinced math is important for programming, check [Ginger Bill at BSC 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNtoDGS4uak)
[Essence of linear algebra by 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) - If you don't know 3Blue1Brown, what are you even doing at this point. This particular one blew my mind.
[BlackPenRedPen](https://www.youtube.com/@blackpenredpen) - The goat. Not much to say.
[Khan Academy](https://en.khanacademy.org/) - I usually like to start light when getting into new math concepts, just learning a bit about everything before leaning proofs and properties and whatever. Khan academy gives a good introduction for new topics, but I would advise for getting into books if you need to get deep into some topic.

## Data oriented design
Programming is pretty much manipulating data. So you should know data really well. Everything here is just suggestions on how to do it, but really good suggestions nonetheless.
[Data-oriented design and C++ by Mike Acton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc) - Must-watch for everyone. Very practical and mindboggling.
[Intro to Data Oriented design for games by Nic Barker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwkuAqObplU) - Not only for game developers! This is a lighter version of the talk by Mike Acton. There are great examples, helps a lot to understand the points made in the original talk.
[Practical Data Oriented Design by Andrew Kelley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IroPQ150F6c) - Zig guy btw. Kind of like the previous one, but it's always good to have a different person explaining the same thing. Also real life examples.
[*memory allocation strategies 1-6*](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2019/02/01/memory-allocation-strategies-001/) - Implementation of memory management systems with actual code! Also Odin guy btw.
[Enter the arena by Ryan Fleury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ5a3gCCZYo) - There is also an article if you don't have headphones on. Helps you get into arenas as a mean of memory management. Not actual real life arenas.

## I don't really know where to put these ones but they are really cool
[CS 361 Systems programming by Chris Kanich](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhy9gU5W1fvUND_5mdpbNVHC1WCIaABbP) - Video series on operating systems, programming tools and more.
[Gaffer on Games](https://gafferongames.com/) - Straight forward articles on game dev, mostly focused on networks. A lot of code snippets and examples.
[Ginger Bill](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/) - Odin man himself.

## Strimmers
I like watching people live and it's also cool to see other programmers doing actual work. Also you can directly ask questions. And laugh.
[ThePrimeAgen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen) - Did you know he worked at Netflix? And he uses Neovim btw? And he uses Arch btw?
[Jonathan Blow](https://www.twitch.tv/j_blow) - He made Braid and The Witness. Also working on his own programming language (Jai) and making a new game with it.
[Quel Solaar](https://www.twitch.tv/quel_solaar) - Goated C programmer.
[cakez77](https://www.twitch.tv/cakez77) - Guy making his own tower defense game in C++.
[Handmade Hero by Casey Muratori](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnuhp3Xd9PYTt6svyQPyRO_AAuMWGxPzU) - An old school game dev making games live, while explaning everything. According to the creator himself, you get the most value of the series after watching around 30 or so videos. This is just a VOD collection, but it is the goto place if you want to learn from watching someone coding live.
